# VAge
VAge Application Development
To create a web application for VAge assessment applicable to daily clinical practice, we developed a web-based VAge predictor using R Shiny (version 1.10.0), providing access to the final trained model. This framework integrated both front-end user interface components and back-end computational logic within a single R environment. The final trained model was loaded directly into the Shiny server, and user inputs were processed through reactive R functions, with prediction results returned to the user.
